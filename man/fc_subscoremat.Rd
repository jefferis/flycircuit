\title{Return scores (or distances) for given query and target neurons}
\usage{
fc_subscoremat(query, target, scoremat, distance = FALSE,
  normalisation = c("raw", "normalised", "mean"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{query,target}{Vectors of FlyCircuit identifiers}

  \item{scoremat}{The name of the score matrix to use. When
  \code{NULL}, this will default to
  \code{'allbyallblastcv2.5.bin'}.}

  \item{distance}{Logical indicating whether to return
  distances or scores.}

  \item{normalisation}{The type of normalisation procedure
  that should be carried out, selected from \code{'raw'},
  \code{'normalised'} or \code{'mean'} (i.e. the average of
  normalised scores in both directions).  If
  \code{distance=TRUE} then this cannot be raw.}
}
\description{
Scores can either be returned as raw numbers, normalised
such that a self-hit has score 1, or as the average of the
normalised scores in both the forwards & reverse directions
(i.e. \code{|query->target| + |target->query| / 2}).
Distances are returned as either \code{1 - normscore} in
the forwards direction, or as \code{1 - normscorebar},
where \code{normscorebar} is \code{normscore} averaged
across both directions.
